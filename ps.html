    <p class="ps-text"> As a woman born and raised in <b>Egypt</b>, I was always fond of the level of education, innovation, 
        and competency the <b>Ancient Egyptians</b> had. Their monuments and stories inspired me and made me recognize l how unique and robust my ancient grandparents were. 
        <b>My grandma</b> always motivated me by mentioning how I relate to this unique and <b>significant history</b> , and that I should serve it till my last breath. 
        That has been one of my very first <b>motives for success</b>.
    </p>
    <img class="ps1-img" src="assets/images/1.png" alt="">
    
    
    <p class="ps-text"> As I grew up, my grandmother noticed my <b>love for mathematics and science</b> and started encouraging me to join engineering. 
        However, I <b>wasn't welcomed as a woman in the mechanical engineering department</b> when I joined my undergraduate program.  
        At this point, I felt how challenging it was to prove myself in this country, especially in this career. 
        However, I resisted this feeling and started thinking about how to improve the education system. 
        I wasn’t delighted with how the instructors were teaching courses. 
        I felt that they could always do more. I sensed a missing connection between the course content and the real world. 
        Then, I decided to take notes and write down the flaws of every teacher and how these flaws can be addressed. 
    </p>
    <img class="ps2-img" src="assets/images/2.png" alt="">
    <p class="ps-text"> Meanwhile, to become an instructor in my country, I had to be from the top 3 in the mechanical engineering department, which was around 350 students (348 men and two women). 
        At this point, I accepted the challenge and started my journey. I <b>stayed at the top of my department for the first two years</b>; then I developed a lot of health issues. 
        Unfortunately, I wasn't in the top 3 anymore and chose to work for the industry instead of being an instructor after graduation. 

    </p>
    <p class="ps-text"> After I joined the industry and tried connecting what was taken in school and what I was experiencing, I felt the huge gap between what I was supposed to achieve on-site vs. what I was taught in school. So I just tried teaching myself how to cope and learn by experience. However, I was still looking for a better outcome, so I decided to pursue a Ph.D. in Mechanical engineering in the USA.</p>
    <p class="ps-text">When I arrived in the US, I was <b>offered a project addressing the need for more project management among capstone design students.</b>  
        At this stage, I had no idea that experiential engineering education existed and that I could pursue my career and <b>spend the rest of it exploring and assessing the reasons behind the gaps between the engineering students’ skill sets when graduated and how the content delivered is impacting students' careers and affecting industrial development.</b> 
        As well as how to help solve some of those problems through different teaching methods and curriculum approaches. 
    </p>
    <img class="ps3-img" src="assets/images/3.png" alt="">
    <p class="ps-text"> All the hardships I <b>faced during my journey gave me a chance to know my strong and weak points, from being a vulnerable woman that’s underrepresented in her country to a strong woman that accepts challenges wherever she is.</b> 
        All of this made me sure that what I am currently doing is my passion and that <b>improving education systems</b> has been a goal of mine since I started undergraduate school. I am excited to share my experiences and future work with the world. 
        Education has always been my passion besides engineering, so joining engineering and then researching how to deliver it to students best is such an excellent opportunity for me.
