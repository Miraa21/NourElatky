    <p class="intm-text">It all started when I was an undergraduate and was always curious to learn more about how professors prepare their content and the ways it can be delivered. I used to classify every professor's teaching method, for the sake of gaining more knowledge besides classifying the teaching methods based on their effectiveness on students. However, at this point, I didn't have enough time to accurately learn about teaching methods and pedagogies but never lost the inner sound that was encouraging me to look into them and how to motivate students, and ways of engineering education improvement.  My graduate studies have been my first practical experience in the field of engineering education, which taught me a lot about teaching pedagogies and opened other topics in engineering education that I didn't know of. In my first year, I started by researching the capstone design courses students and assessing their project management skills and team culture, which led me to conclude the importance of teaching students professional/non-technical skills before joining the workforce. The research results were published in an ASEE conference paper in 2020. Then, I took a workshop that made me understand how to deal with students, effectively teach them, and run classes as active teaching classes.
    </p>
    <p class="intm-text">At this point, I started my TA ship, and it was my first time helping out students in class and torturing them sometimes. It was my first teaching experience, and I used this opportunity to change the class setting from a regular classroom environment to an active learning class. 
        
    </p>
    <p class="intm-text">In my second year, I had some health issues that forced me to take a step back and focus on my health. However, that gave me a good break that helped me find my career path. 
    </p>
    <p class="intm-text">In my third year, I pursued my learning opportunity and started digging more into the faculty’s effective communication methods and how they affect the students’ motivation and success. I learned a lot about the MUSIC model and different motivation theories and how I can use them to assess engineering students and help them get motivated in the classroom and throughout their careers. 
    </p>
    <p class="intm-text">At this time, I realized that there are a lot of topics I need to know more about, especially in the engineering education field. So I decided to drop my ME Ph.D. and join the Engineering Education department graduate program. I feel it’s worth mentioning that I haven't understood the importance of engineering education till I was a part of it. 
    </p>
    <p class="intm-text">Since last year, I started to gain a deeper understanding of different aspects of engineering education and pursued research in other engineering education areas. I am currently working on three different projects. The first one is developing a new curriculum for the electrical engineering department at Rowan University to better serve the smart grid industry. In a quick double time, I gained significant knowledge in qualitative analysis. That allowed me to have 5 students under my supervision and teach them how to run qualitative analyses and develop a code book that leads to creating a curriculum objective list. The second is validating the MUSIC Model in different engineering settings, which helped me develop excellent quantitative skills such as quantitative modeling, analytical skills, and surveying skills. Besides running different types of analysis such as ANOVA, multiple regression, descriptive statistics, correlational, and causal-comparative/quasi-experimental attempts to establish cause-effect relationships among the variables all via SPSS. As well as a decent network with professors in NJ Virginia and North Carolina that are experts in engineering education and psychology. The aforementioned network helped deepen my knowledge of psychology and education, and understand different pedagogies and approaches in the two fields and how to connect with engineering education and industry, especially from the motivational theory lens. Hence, conducting these projects continues to build upon my experience as an engineering education researcher and will manifest in a few publications in the coming year. 
    </p>
    <p class="intm-text">Last but not least, I had the opportunity to effectively assess the FEC section students by delivering the theoretical content they needed in an active learning environment and helping them digest the engineering fundamentals in a fun and friendly environment.
    </p>
    <h1 class="psline">Broader Impact</h1>
        <img class="line" src="assets/images/line.png" alt="">

        <p class="brimp-text">One of my lifelong career goals is to enhance engineering education to better serve the industry by developing knowledgeable and experienced undergraduate engineers. Based on my previous work I concluded that enforcing hands-on experiences, that reflect the industrial perspective of undergraduate students, by working on industry-based projects through their four years learning journey, will help in amplifying their knowledge in the practical experience they need to have before joining the workforce. Based on the compounding theory the more real-world experiences they are exposed to the more they will be ready when they join the workforce. Additionally,  this will help them advance to higher levels in their career sooner. Especially since the Industry expects more real-world experiences applied in undergraduate courses to provide the students with the missing skillsets, including hands-on experiences, organizational interactions, budgeting, teamwork, and other non-technical skills. Although much effort is being put into academic research to fill the gap between industry expectations and engineering undergraduate students' academic skill sets, the industry is not yet satisfied with the outcomes</p>
        <p class="brimp-text">Based on the stakeholder's theory findings and the arguments found in the stakeholder theory literature, in which relationships are based on the following principles: knowledge and information sharing, mutual trust, involvement in the decision-making process, and alignment of stakeholders’ interests in the strategic planning process[1], I am interested in investigating the efforts and collaborations of the engineering education stakeholders such as academia, government, institutes, and industry for filling this gap and creating more value for organizations. Based on my previous research in the engineering education field which mostly focused on students' skills and industry requirements, I am planning to keep investigating the gap between industry and Academia throughout my career.</p>
        <p class="brimp-text">First is being a faculty member that applies the best techniques that serve students and industry, besides advancing in my career and knowledge of curriculum development till I reach an administrative point where I can set some rules or create collaborations between industry and Academia, or by joining one of the professional societies as ABET.
