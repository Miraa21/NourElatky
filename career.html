    <p class="intm-text">My graduate studies have been my first experience in the field of engineering education. However, I gained a lot of knowledge from it.In my first year, I started by researching the capstone design courses students and assessing their project management skills as well as their team culture, and that led me to the conclusion of the importance of teaching students professional/non-technical skills before joining the workforce. The research results were published in an ASEE conference paper in 2020. Then, I took workshops that made me understand how to deal with students, effectively teach them, and run classes as active teaching classes. 
    </p>
    <p class="intm-text">At this point, I started my TA ship, and it was my first time helping out students in class and torturing them sometimes. It was my first teaching experience, and I used this opportunity to change the class setting from a regular classroom environment to an active learning class. 
    </p>
    <p class="intm-text">In my second year, I had some health issues that forced me to take a step back and focus on my health. However, that gave me a good break that helped me find my career path. 
    </p>
    <p class="intm-text">In my third year, I pursued back my learning opportunity and started digging more into the faculty’s effective communication methods and how it is affecting the students’ motivation and success. I learned a lot about the MUSIC model and different motivation theories and how I can use them to assess engineering students and help them get motivated in the classroom and throughout their careers.</p>
    <p class="intm-text">At this time, I realized that there are a lot of topics I need to know more about, especially in the engineering education field. So I decided to drop my ME Ph.D. and join the Engineering Education department graduate program. I feel it’s worth mentioning that I haven't understood the importance of engineering education till I was a part of it. 
    </p>
    <p class="intm-text">Since last year, I started to gain a deeper understanding of different aspects of engineering education and pursued research in other engineering education areas. I am currently working on three different projects. The first one is developing a new curriculum for the electrical engineering department at Rowan University to better serve the smart grid industry. In double quick time, I gained great knowledge in qualitative analysis. That allowed me to have 2-3 students under my supervision and teach them how to run qualitative analysis and develop a code book that leads to creating a curriculum objective list. The second is validating the MUSIC Model in different engineering settings, and that helped me develop very good quantitative skills such as creating and conducting surveys,  and running different types of analysis as ANOVA, multiple regression, descriptive statistics, ...etc via spss. As well as a decent network with different faculty in NJ, Virginia, and North Carolina that are experts in engineering education and psychology. The aforementioned network helped deepen my knowledge of psychology and education, and understand different pedagogies and approaches in the two fields and how to connect with engineering education and industry. The third project, which will serve as a part of my Ph.D., is finding if the gap between industry expectations and engineering students’ skillsets is caused due to the lack of collaboration between engineering education stakeholders. Hence, conducting these projects serves to continue to build upon my experience as an engineering education researcher and will manifest in a few publications in the coming year. 
    </p>
    <p class="intm-text">Last but not least, I had the opportunity to effectively assess the FEC section students by delivering the theoretical content they need in an active learning environment and helping them digest the engineering fundamentals in a fun and friendly environment
    </p>
    <h1 class="psline">Broader Impact</h1>
        <img class="line" src="images/line.png" alt="">

        <p class="brimp-text">One of my life-long career goals is to enhance engineering education to better serve the industry by developing knowledgeable and experienced undergraduate engineers. Based on my previous work I concluded that enforcing real-world experiences to undergraduate students by working on industry-based projects through their four years learning journey,  will help them develop faster in the industry. As based on the compounded theory the more real-world experiences they are exposed to the more they will be ready when they join the workforce.   Especially since the Industry expects more real-world experiences applied in undergraduate courses to provide the students with the missing skillsets, including hands-on experiences, organizational interactions, budgeting, teamwork, and other non-technical skills. On the other hand, much effort is being put into academic research to fill the gap between industry expectations and engineering undergraduate students' academic skill sets.
        </p>
        <p class="brimp-text">Based on the stakeholder's theory findings and the arguments found in the stakeholder theory literature, in which relationships are based on the following principles: knowledge and information sharing, mutual trust, involvement in the decision-making process, and alignment of stakeholders’ interests in the strategic planning process, I am interested in investigating the efforts and collaborations of the engineering education stakeholders such as academia, government, institutes, and industry for filling this gap and creating more value for organizations. Based on my previous research in the engineering education field which mostly focused on students' skills and industry requirements, I am planning to keep investigating the gap between industry and Academia throughout my career. Either by being a faculty that applies the best techniques that serve students and industry and hopefully advancing till I reach an administrative point where I can set some rules or create collaborations between industry and Academia, or by joining one of the professions. societies as ABET, or ASEE. Therefore,  I see myself as the best candidate to address this topic. Especially since I had a decent amount of industrial experience in Egypt and the USA.
