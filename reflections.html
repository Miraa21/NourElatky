        </h5>
    <p class="keywords">Identity - Motivation - Different Mindsets - Inclusion<br>
        Co-curricular Activities - Professional Development
       </p>
       <img class="r1-img" src="assets/images/factors affectting academic career .jpeg" alt="">

       <p class="r-text">There were several factors that affected my academic performance and career since I was an undergraduate. Motivation was the most important factor of them all whether positive or negative. I always say that “motivation is one of the main aspects affecting students' outcomes”,  as I am the type of person that doesn't let external factors affect their motivation or inner instincts. There are things that can definitely affect my performance whether positively or negatively, but I always find a way to stay motivated. For instance, I usually read or listen to books or people that move my instincts, which helps in achieving my goals and keeps me	motivated. The second thing I do is setting an ultimate goal; I typically have a note upfront reminding me of this goal, so that whenever I feel down I have something that reminds me of the reasons I started what I am doing. All the above helped me keep pushing my limits and transfer from mechanical engineering major to engineering education major, to be able to help more students work on their motivation, and reach their goals. </p>
    <p class="r-text">The second factor was my identity. As a woman I faced a lot of hardships to be able to pursue my degree in engineering in my country. Fighting a middle-eastern culture mindset is really hard, especially when it comes to males and females, and what professions are most appropriate for each of them. However, that taught me how to accept differences regardless of my background. As people are different, whether from a personal perspective or a cultural background. Accepting different identities  is a major factor in a country like the US, especially that every classroom can contain multiple students' backgrounds. So I am glad that my experience gave me the ability to accept others.</p>
    <p class="r-text">Another side of the hardships I faced during my undergraduate studies was the fear of being not welcomed. I always believed that the effect of inclusion can impact your entire experience in a place or a career path. When I moved to the US I really felt comfortable and satisfied when I heard professors mentioning my cultural background or celebrating any religious festival that I belong to. That taught me the importance of including every student in a classroom so that they feel comfortable and just focus on the class deliverables. 
        Although I was trying to prove myself as a woman, I had other women that gave me great chances to be able to build my personalities through different Co Curricular activities which made my character strong enough to be able to live abroad without my parents. 
        </p>
    <p class="r-text">Finally, I try to gain knowledge from multiple elements such as teaching, research, leadership, and committees to be able to develop my professional skills and capabilities. </p>
    <p class="r-text">As this knowledge helps me interconnect between all the factors affecting my career. As I always had the tendency to be an agent if change!

        <h5 class="text-theme">Theme 2:  Fulfilling industrial needs
        </h5>
    <p class="keywords">Stakeholders Collaborations - Curricula <br> Hands-on - 
        Cognitive Situation Framework 

       </p>
       <img class="r1-img" src="assets/images/Fullfiling industrial needs.jpeg" alt="">

    <p class="r-text">From my research, work, and educational experience I noticed that there are industrial needs from academia that are not yet fulfilled. Although a lot of research is applied in this area, still a lot of work is needed. For instance, curriculums that get tailored based on the industrial needs are one of the main aspects in developing the engineering education. The project I am currently working on gave me the chance to collaborate with different industries and understand their requirements, and all of them agreed that there is a great need for enhancing the collaborations between engineering education stakeholders specially between industry and academia. Multiple industrial professionals said that “Changing engineering curricula to meet the industrial needs has a great impact on decreasing the gap between academia and industry”. Not only changing curriculums will satisfy industry but also changing the way students learn. Applying cognitive situative frameworks has a strong positive impact on engineering students as they don't just depend on theories but also have hands-on experience. 
    </p>
    
    <img class="theme" src="assets/images/themee.jpeg" alt="">
        <h5 class="text-theme">Theme 3: Effective Teaching
        </h5>
    <p class="keywords">Education mindset - Motivation <br> Curriculums 
         learning theories 


       </p>
       <img class="r1-img" src="assets/images/effective-teaching.jpeg" alt="">

    <p class="r-text">To have qualified engineers that satisfies the industry the change is not just in curriculums but also the way of teaching. It’s a flow of developments in the whole education mindset. Therefore, we shouldn’t just have qualified engineers in the field but also look for ways to improve the whole engineering mindset so that students can digest the content as much as possible. That’s why the experimental engineering education major falls between engineering and education, as it develops the education process to enhance engineering students' learning capabilities. </p>
    <p class="r-text">One of the very strong factors that affect the educational system is students’ motivation, as it has a direct impact on students' outcomes. There are multiple sources of students' motivation, but I would like to focus on how faculty’s effective communication affects students' motivation. From past experiences I noticed that assessing students with the least stress possible besides cheering them on the positive work as discussion questions and group activities. However, bad ethical decisions from instructors negatively impact students' motivations by underestimating their abilities. 
    </p>
    <p class="r-text">Besides the different frameworks that faculty need to be trained on and be able choose the suitable framework for the suitable content. For example, the cognitive situative framework is the most relevant framework to my engineering education. As I always believe in building knowledge on long-term memory information. As well as practicing the new knowledge learnt in the real world is the best way to deliver and learn new talents and information. From my past experiences and research, I noticed that students usually prefer connecting their understanding and the learning concepts they learn with applying their knowledge with their hands as it helps them use all their senses.
